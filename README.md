## Requirements
1. Create project using [Chisel](https://www.getchisel.co/)
2. Use HTML5 / SCSS
3. Make it responsive using your best judgement.
4. Create a simple custom overlay for photos - use only vanilla JavaScript, do not use jQuery or any other external libraries for it.
5. Create some hover effect for the image thumbnails.
6. Make the page the smallest possible size - ensure that images are properly optimized, resources minified, etc.
7. *Optional bonus task 1:* Make images responsive
8. *Optional bonus task 2:* Add basic routing – make browser's back button work properly; open overlay based on URL.

## Supported browsers
Ensure that the elements work and display correctly in the following browsers:

- Firefox (latest version)
- Google Chrome (latest version)
- Microsoft Edge
- Internet Explorer 11

## Coding Standards
When working on the project use consistent coding style. Try to follow what's already in Chisel - EditorConfig, stylelint, ESLint (see [Code Quality](https://www.getchisel.co/docs/development/code-quality/)), [ITCSS](https://www.getchisel.co/docs/development/itcss/), etc.

## Project Deadline
Take your time but try to deliver it within 2 weeks time. If we don't see any activity in your test repository after 2 weeks (at least initial commits), we will automatically withdraw your application.
